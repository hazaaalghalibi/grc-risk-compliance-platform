- File servers showing encrypted files with .locked extension
- Ransom note demanding 50 Bitcoin (approximately $2.5M) within 72 hours
- Active Directory appears compromised
- Email servers are partially affected
- Customer-facing systems are still operational but internal systems are impacted

The ransomware appears to have spread through a phishing email opened by an employee in the finance department three days ago.`,

    scenarioNarrative: `Your security team discovers evidence that an unauthorized party accessed your customer database approximately 2 weeks ago. Initial investigation reveals:

- Approximately 50,000 customer records were accessed
- Data includes names, email addresses, and encrypted passwords
- No financial data (credit cards) appears to be affected
- Access occurred through a compromised API key
- The breach was discovered through unusual API usage patterns

You are now 4 hours into the investigation. The extent may grow as investigation continues.`,
