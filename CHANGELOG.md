# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to follow Semantic Versioning where practical.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

#### Platform Hardening Follow-Ups — May 2026

Six-PR follow-up train (#305–#310) addressing pattern-sweep extensions,
carry-over items from earlier audits, multi-tenant + RBAC test coverage,
backend test infrastructure, accessibility/visual regression coverage,
and removal of the backup-scheduler's docker socket dependency.

##### Connector SSRF Coverage (#305)

- Migrated 7 remaining integration connectors from raw `axios` to
  `safeFetch` (`cloud-connectors`, `itam-connectors`, `hr-connectors`,
  `productivity-connectors`, `devops-connectors`, `finance-connectors`,
  `additional-connectors`). Operator-supplied `baseUrl`/`tokenUrl` are
  now validated against the private-IP / metadata-endpoint blocklist
  before any outbound call.
- `SSRFProtectionError` is caught per-endpoint and surfaced as a
  structured failure rather than an unhandled exception.

##### File Upload Hardening (#305)

- Added MIME allowlist + size cap to 5 additional upload endpoints
  matching the contracts.controller pattern from PR #301:
  evidence (50 MB; pdf/png/jpeg/csv/xlsx/docx/txt/json),
  BCDR plans (25 MB; pdf/docx/txt),
  training materials (25 MB; mp4/pdf/jpg/png + SCORM),
  framework imports (25 MB; csv/xlsx),
  policies (25 MB; pdf/docx/md/txt).
- Each endpoint exports `*_MIME_ALLOWLIST` and `*_MAX_BYTES` constants
  alongside a named `fileFilter`, so the policy is reviewable in source.

##### Tenant Isolation Hardening (#308)

- Questionnaires and Knowledge Base controllers no longer accept
  `organizationId` from the request body. Both controllers now
  spread `user.organizationId` over the DTO before passing to the
  service. Previously any authenticated user could POST a record
  under any tenant.
- Frameworks, Policies, and Integrations controllers had no
  `RolesGuard` wired — viewer/auditor roles could POST/PUT/DELETE
  freely. Fixed by adding `@UseGuards(DevAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` at
  class level + `@Roles(...)` on every mutation route.
- Frameworks and Policies services now register
  `GlobalExceptionFilter` in `main.ts`, so `ForbiddenException` from
  `RolesGuard` returns 403 instead of a generic 500.

##### Backup Scheduler Privilege Reduction (#310)

- Removed `/var/run/docker.sock` mount from the `backup-scheduler`
  service in `docker-compose.prod.yml`. A compromised backup container
  can no longer introspect or control other containers.
- Switched data-plane movement to direct network commands: `pg_dump`
  over TCP to postgres, `redis-cli --rdb` over TCP to redis,
  `mc mirror` (existing) over the S3 API to rustfs.
- Added `cap_drop: ALL` to the backup-scheduler service.
- Redis **cold restore** is now a documented manual procedure
  (`deploy/README.md`) because redis only loads `dump.rdb` at server
  startup; this is acceptable here because redis is cache-only.

##### Base Image Digest Refresh (#307)

- Re-pinned `node:20-alpine` and `nginx:alpine` digests across all 7
  Dockerfiles. Trivy HIGH/CRITICAL count on the refreshed images
  dropped accordingly.

##### Trust Center URL Cleanup (#307)

- Removed `organizationId` from public trust-center share URLs in
  `TrustCenterSettings`. The backend already resolves the org from
  the authenticated context — the query parameter was cosmetic
  information disclosure, not exploitable.

### Added

#### Mapping Derived Views (PR-D)

- New `MappingCoverageWidget` (`frontend/src/components/widgets/MappingCoverageWidget.tsx`)
  rendered in two modes:
  - **Aggregate** on the dashboard — percent of org controls with at
    least one mapping, with a `{mapped}/{total} — {unmapped} unmapped`
    breakdown.
  - **Per-framework** on the framework detail page — percent of that
    framework's requirements with at least one mapping. Gated on
    `frameworks:read`. Reuses the existing `/control-coverage` and
    `/requirement-coverage/:frameworkId` endpoints (no new backend).
- New `GET /api/mappings/gaps` endpoint
  (`@Roles('admin','compliance_manager','auditor')`) returning the union
  of three gap categories with optional `frameworkId` + `type` filters:
  - `no-controls`: requirements with zero mappings.
  - `supporting-only`: requirements with mappings but no `primary`.
  - `unused-controls`: controls with no mappings (org-scoped;
    `frameworkId` ignored for this type).
    Returns `[]` (not 404) on empty result. Tenant-isolated via
    OR-organization check on the underlying framework and control rows.
- New `/reports/mapping-gaps` page (`frontend/src/pages/MappingGaps.tsx`)
  mounted under `<ModuleRoute module="compliance">`. Tabs for all three
  gap types plus an "All gap types" combined view, framework filter
  (disabled on the unused-controls tab), CSV export
  (`mapping-gaps-{type-or-all}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv`) via the existing
  `ExportDropdown`, and PDF export via dynamic-imported `jspdf` +
  `html2canvas` (no new npm deps). Row click navigates to the relevant
  framework or control detail page.
- New **Copy to framework…** kebab menu item on every mapping chip in
  `FrameworkDetail.tsx` and `ControlDetail.tsx`, inserted between
  **Edit** and **Delete**. Gated on `controls:update`. Opens
  `MappingEditorModal` in `control-to-requirements` mode seeded with the
  source mapping's type and notes via two new optional props
  (`defaultMappingType`, `defaultNotes`); duplicate-framework rejection
  is enforced server-side and surfaces as a toast.

#### Control ↔ Requirement Mapping UI Foundation (PR-A)

- New `PATCH /api/mappings/:id` endpoint allowing admin /
  compliance_manager to update an existing mapping's `mappingType` or
  `notes`. Tenant-isolated via OR-organization check on both the
  control's and the framework's org.
- New `ControlMappingHistory` table capturing every mapping mutation
  (create, update, delete, restore) with full snapshot.
  `onDelete: SetNull` so history outlives parent deletion. Indexed
  `(mappingId, changedAt desc)`.
- New `MappingHistoryService.record()` invoked inside the same
  `prisma.$transaction` as every mapping write — guarantees the history
  row lands atomically with the data change.
- New `frontend/src/components/mappings/MappingEditorModal` — shared
  two-mode modal (`requirement-to-controls` and
  `control-to-requirements`) with stage machine (search → multi-select
  → per-row-form → submit). Supports both create (via `bulkCreate`)
  and edit (via `update`).
- `FrameworkDetail.tsx` and `ControlDetail.tsx`: "Mapped Controls" /
  "Framework Mappings" chip lists now have an "Add mapping…" button
  and per-chip kebab menu (Edit / Delete). Gated on `controls:update`
  / `controls:delete`. Previously read-only.
- `frameworks` service now has its own `AuditService` (copied from
  `policies`); all four mapping mutations fire both `AuditLog` (org
  feed) and `ControlMappingHistory` (entity feed).

#### Multi-Tenant + RBAC E2E Coverage (#308)

- New Playwright specs that gate PR merges:
  - `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts` (44 tests, 10 resource
    types). For each resource: cross-tenant GET/PUT/DELETE returns
    404 (no existence disclosure), cross-tenant POST is rejected or
    silently scoped to the caller's org.
  - `frontend/e2e/rbac.spec.ts` (50 tests). Role × action matrix
    for admin / compliance_manager / auditor / viewer against
    controls, evidence, frameworks, policies, integrations.
- Test infrastructure additions:
  - `services/shared/src/seed/seed-constants.ts` exports stable
    UUIDs for Org A, Org B, and the 5 seeded users.
  - `services/controls/src/seed/seed.service.ts` seeds Org B with
    1 admin + 5 controls + 3 risks + 2 vendors so cross-tenant
    tests have something to target. Idempotent.
  - `DevAuthGuard` honors an `x-dev-user-id` header in dev/test
    environments only, looking the value up in an in-memory fixture
    table to authenticate as any of the 5 seeded users without a
    real Keycloak round-trip.
  - `frontend/e2e/auth.setup.ts` produces 6 storage states
    (`user.json` legacy + adminA/complianceA/auditorA/viewerA/adminB);
    `playwright.config.ts` defines 5 role/tenant-specific projects.
- New required CI job `e2e-tenant-rbac` brings up the dev stack,
  seeds, and runs both specs. Blocks PR merge on failure.

#### Accessibility + Visual Regression E2E (#309, report-only)

- `frontend/e2e/a11y.spec.ts` runs `@axe-core/playwright` against
  every primary route and reports WCAG violations.
- `frontend/e2e/visual.spec.ts` snapshots 8 high-signal pages
  (dashboard, controls list, control detail, frameworks list,
  policies list, vendors list, audits list, settings, trust-center).
  Baselines committed under `frontend/e2e/__snapshots__/`.
- New CI job `e2e-quality-checks` runs both specs.
  **Report-only:** `continue-on-error: true` and omitted from the
  `status` rollup. Will flip to blocking once baselines stabilize.

#### Backend Jest Coverage (#306)

- Wired Jest in `audit`, `policies`, `tprm`, and `trust` services
  (the latter three previously had no `npm test` script). `controls`
  and `frameworks` already had test setup.
- Two pre-existing dormant specs in `audit`
  (`audits.service.spec.ts`, `findings.service.spec.ts`) are now
  actually executed by CI.
- Starter Prisma-mocked specs added to `policies`, `tprm`, `trust`
  covering one happy-path and one tenant-isolation case per service.

### Changed

#### Empty Catch Handler (#305)

- `frontend/src/pages/Integrations.tsx` — replaced
  `.catch(() => null)` on `getTypes()` with a `console.warn` that
  preserves the error before returning null. Last empty `.catch`
  handler in the frontend.

#### Organization ID Helper (#305)

- Consolidated 3 `localStorage.getItem('organizationId')` fallbacks
  in `frontend/src/lib/{api.ts,setupFetchAuth.ts,api/client.ts}` to
  a single `getCurrentOrgId()` helper in `secureStorage.ts`. The
  fallback now returns `null` when both stores are empty so the
  calling layer fails loud rather than sending a request without an
  org header.

### Documentation

- **CHANGELOG.md** — this entry.
- **frontend/e2e/README.md** — documented the multi-user auth
  fixture system (6 storage states, 5 role/tenant projects), the
  `x-dev-user-id` header override, the a11y / visual specs, and how
  to refresh visual baselines.
- **docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md** — added connector SSRF coverage to the
  SSRF section, file-upload allowlist pattern to the File Upload
  Security section, tenant-isolation e2e gate to the Tenant
  Isolation section, and a new Backup Scheduler subsection under
  Infrastructure Hardening.
- **docs/PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md** — added a note that the role matrix
  is now enforced by `frontend/e2e/rbac.spec.ts`.
- **docs/DEVELOPMENT.md** and **CONTRIBUTING.md** — backend testing
  sections updated; `npm test` now works in all 6 services.
- **deploy/README.md** and **deploy/QUICKSTART.md** — updated for
  the no-docker.sock backup procedure and the Redis cold-restore
  manual workflow.

- Fixed AWS connector dynamic imports to use runtime `require()` for optional SDK packages
- Fixed Azure evidence collector dynamic imports
- Fixed ScheduledReports component to display loading state

### Migration Notes

#### Security Configuration (Recommended)

These changes are backwards compatible, but we recommend configuring the new security features:

1. **Proxy Authentication** (if using auth proxy):

   ```bash
   # Generate a secure secret
   AUTH_PROXY_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

   # Configure your auth proxy to send this as x-proxy-secret header
   # Then enable enforcement
   REQUIRE_PROXY_AUTH=true
   ```

2. **CORS Origins** (if using Trust service externally):

   ```bash
   # Set allowed origins for Trust service
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://grc.yourcompany.com,https://trust.yourcompany.com
   ```

3. **Encryption Format**: No action required. The new encryption format with random salts is backwards compatible. Existing encrypted data will continue to work. New data will use the more secure format.

4. **Docker Compose**: If deploying to production, use `docker-compose.prod.yml` instead of `docker-compose.yml`. The development compose file now includes prominent security warnings.
